My name is Gajaba Naraddage (I go by Jaba), and I am a 24 year old student who had just graduated from University of Illinois, studying molecular biology with a minor in computer science. My goal by enrolling in the MIT course is to acquire the base skills through MERN stack to eventually take on the coding languages involved with blockchain, such as Solidity.
