This is my first attempt at building a website, utilizing HTML and other languages taught by the MIT xPRO coding course.
I have uploaded and linked all respective files to their repositories including the PacMan, Eyes, and Bus Tracker project.
Some thing to improve on once acquiring better understanding of HMTL would be making navbar visible, organizing the links respectively, and centering of all text/included images.
